# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Customer's Reviews for Food Products Using Machine Learning Approach

This repository contains Python code for a project that focuses on sentiment analysis of product reviews. The project implements and compares three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm. It uses a dataset of product reviews from Amazon customers and explores the impact of different features on classifier performance.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a sentiment analysis classifier for product reviews.
- **Dataset**: Reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products.
- **Classification Task**: Given a review, classify it as positive (+1) or negative (-1).

## Project Structure

- `project1.py`: Implementation of learning algorithms and hinge loss functions.
- `main.py`: Script for running experiments using the implemented classifiers.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions provided by the project staff.
- `test.py`: Script to run tests on the implemented methods.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset in `.tsv` format.
- `stopwords.txt`: List of stopwords for text preprocessing.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Setup

- Python version: 3.8
- Required libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Customers-Reviews-for-Food-Products-Using-Machine-Learning-Approach.git
   
## Results
Experiment with different features and hyperparameters to achieve the best classifier performance.
You can visualize and analyze the results using Matplotlib in main.py.
