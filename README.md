# Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews

This repository contains Python code for a project that focuses on sentiment analysis of product reviews. The project implements and compares three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm. It uses a dataset of product reviews from Amazon customers and explores the impact of different features on classifier performance.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a sentiment analysis classifier for product reviews.
- **Dataset**: Reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products.
- **Classification Task**: Given a review, classify it as positive (+1) or negative (-1).

## Project Structure

- `project1.py`: Implementation of learning algorithms and hinge loss functions.
- `main.py`: Script for running experiments using the implemented classifiers.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions provided by the project staff.
- `test.py`: Script to run tests on the implemented methods.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset in `.tsv` format.
- `stopwords.txt`: List of stopwords for text preprocessing.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Setup

- Python version: 3.8
- Required libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib
